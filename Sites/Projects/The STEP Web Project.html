                            A little bit of extra information about myself; I sat the STEP exam in 2022, aka the Sixth-Term Examination Paper.
                            I didn't do too bad; I achieved a 1 in STEP 2, and a 2 in STEP 3. However, I realised that there are so many
                            resources for STEP, and a lot of advice I wish I was given when I did the exam (i.e the cliche motivation for
                            any tutor-esque website). As a result, I did the sane thing and took on html, css and a little bit of javascript
                            to try and create a website, because web design is cool. Naturally, the site has a lot of typos I was too lazy to fix,
                            and the overall design is shabby, but hey, it was my first site. You can find it <a target="_blank" href="https://yolo2546.github.io">here</a>.

                            When it comes to learning new skills, it's a really good idea to look for youtube playlists (from the same channel)
                            rather than individual tutorials, because not only is there a lot more content than from a single video, but the
                            tutorials have no overlap. The playlist I recommend is by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYCgNOIyGABDU532eesybur5HPBVfC1G"
                            >LearnCode.Academy</a>. The tutorials are really concise yet also very detailed. The only thing it doesn't touch
                            upon is javascript but for web design javascript is best reserved for specific requirements such as carousels and
                            collapsibles.

                            In general, when you post something online you should be fairly careful to not post a picture that isn't yours,
                            and even more in general, I have a sever lack of maths related photos. So, I decided to use my 3d printed models
                            of 'cones' from a different project I did (I might post about it later on). These shapes were an edit of a cone.
                            By graphing a cone symmetrically on the x-z plane, such that the slope of cone was vertical (and the 'apex' was
                            at the origin), any cut in the y-z plane would form a parabola (because it's parallel to the slope). By generating
                            the cone <i>from</i> the parabola, I was able to change it so that it formed a quartic, hyperbolic cosine and so
                            on and so forth. The shapes aren't particularly useful, but they look nice as a desk item. The write-up of this
                            project can be found <a target="_blank" href="..\..\Data\Cone Project.pdf">here</a>.

                            Overall, the site is poorly designed. The footer isn't really a footer in most of the pages, the header of the
                            page jolts when the navbar is readjusted to the top of the page, and the aesthetic overall is bland, much like
                            my personality. However, looking back, I do really like the design of the card, with the blue top and bottom
                            borders. However, as I mentioned the site is poorly designed, and I made it with a hacksaw; that is I took
                            long and complicated div patterns to get the result I wanted.

                            Perhaps the coolest thing I have with the site was the coding of the collabsibles. However, I myself
                            cannot take credit for the design (although now I have built up enough javascript knowledge to do them
                            myself), that credit is down to this youtube tutorial:

                            The site, much like this one, is saved on github pages, hence why it has a strange URL. However, you can still
                            publish a website using Google's search console. I won't talk much about this, because I haven't quite got the
                            hang of it, but you can easily learn how to by searching 'How to publish a github site using Google Search
                            Console' or something along those lines. That aside, there isn't really much more to say on the site; feel free
                            to share it with friends if they are taking STEP exams I guess.
