                        <p style="text-align: center;">I, much like most people, found myself absolutely bored
                            throughout the year of 2020. As a result, much like those
                            people, I found myself a hobby. 10 guesses what that was. That's right! I practiced the
                            yo-yo. On the side I also
                            did a small thing called drawing portraits. Needless to say; that was fun. Also, it was
                            very, <i>very</i> bad.
                            As a result, feel free to click through a year's worth of drawing and see myself get
                            slightly better. In addition
                            to that, feel free to read my notes on them all.

                        <p style="text-align: center;">So the first of the train. Pretty much testing the waters for
                            art. Eyes are clearly a strong suit; everything else needs work My general learning
                            background was the basic 'working by halves' technique. Here was my first time using grids
                            (I use dots since lines come easy for me to visualise). Anyway. First lesson, hair is
                            spaghetti like. I should have mimicked the density I used on the side for the foreground.
                            Also, blending is a big issue.

                            spaghetti hair. This angle and detail level is just too much for someone with too little

                            the background so none of the white shines through. Proportions are slightly off. Clearly
                            I'm failing on hair on all accounts of colour, proportion and shape; I should do more </p>

                            tones are clearly a problem but clothes seem to be working well. Lips need a bit of

                        <p style="text-align: center;">Better texture and shading. Teeth needs work and details need to
                            be improved upon by a large degree. I might procrastinate on teeth for now :p.</p>

                            change and the outline looks too square and straight; I need to work on better shaping

                            Take liberties with the reference; if I know that I'm not ready for warmer lighting, don't
                            go crazy with the orange pencil on the face

                            Easily the worst of the lot. It was a wake up call that I need to have a better
                            understanding of colour so I could implement shades much better. Giving up and then
                            scribbling the skin tones in at the end didn't help either. But I do want to point out that
                            it's OK to point out a lost cause and move on if you're not getting anywhere

                            nit-picks is the issue with texturing his shirt and the relative proportion on the eyes

                            If your detail isn't good enough, choose a frame that makes it obvious that one thing is a
                            collar and the other the shoulder. Contour with a dark pencil and colour at the same time.
                            Doing the latter first can end making it too powerful. I have no idea where to begin with
                            highlights as big as the one in the reference:

                            At the time I logged it (since it was my first non-photorealistic project and major project
                            (all projects prior I rushed in under an hour; this was done in a week):
                            So this is a stitched scan, so you may notice a line across the centre. Let's begin:
                            <br><br>
                            - Death. So I went for realism, didn't realise that it's near impossible to create realism
                            from scratch even for the best of artists so 0_o my disappointment was immense. The umbrella
                            did light up my face. I kept her hands covered up to make it easier.
                            <br><br>
                            - Dream: This should be eas- never mind. I'll come back later
                            <br><br>
                            - Destiny: Not too troublesome. I looked up assassin creed fan art tutorials to learn how to
                            make a hood. Though I made the mistake of putting the sigil at the light end as opposed to
                            the dark end, which led to a domino effect of almost all of them being difficult to spot
                            <br><br>
                            - Destruction: Easy enough to draw. Based the body off Smallville Clark Kent. The head looks
                            awful with that beard outline; might have to come back to it
                            <br><br>
                            - Dream (again): Head seems fine. I can use that meme hand drawing for it. Used the locus of
                            the wrist and the shoulder to place the elbow. The hair seems tricky. I just winged it with
                            spikes; seems decent enough. At this point it's clear that the black colouring pencil does
                            not compare to a normal pencil
                            <br><br>
                            - Despair: Pretty easy. I'm used to heads and the eye is the easiest bit. Though the realism
                            of the tear of the eye in relation to the lack of realism in the face makes the tear easy to
                            miss.
                            <br><br>
                            - Desire: I couldn't think of a pose. Then I searched it up and pretty much ctrl C ctrl V
                            the image it was that good. It could be considered cheating since I never used a direct ref
                            for the others nor have I used artwork in itself as a direct ref at all but meh.
                            <br><br>
                            - Destruction (again): I just braved the colouring since getting a usable face to begin with
                            took hours. Turns out that the beard outline was quite deceptive and the end product was not
                            that bad
                            <br><br>
                            - Delirium: Hardest for last ig. The body wasn't too bad to make. The too big jacket was an
                            artistic choice btw, but I really failed to show gravity's effect on the clothing (I tried
                            making the jacket sort of fold but it doesn't seem natural). But it turned out alrightish
                            for the colouring. Though I must say; leather is a pain to colour, especially black leather.
                            <br><br>
                            Moving on: Definitely need to stop relying on blur to cover up screwups in detail, and I
                            really need to get more saturation from my pencils, even if they're not that good.

                            Mostly inspired from Jono Dry's eye. I was curious how much better I can draw if the detail

                            Right then. At face value it's decent; I was quite pleased with the waistcoat. I thought
                            this frame would mean less need of skin tones (I only have one pencil per skin tone (orange
                            and pink on top lightly helps but isn't as realistic). It did work, but the problem was that
                            the reference was highly saturated; I couldn't quite reach the level of saturation required;
                            you can see on the coat I pressed as hard as I could to reach a red. Though I do think I
                            could have done more to adjust to low depth of colour.

                            clothing; I need to make it more photorealistic

                            A remake of my failed attempt from before. I decided to take the reference and make the hair
                            greener on photoshop. I upped the contrast too. There aren't any glaring issues. By this
                            point, I'm pretty satisfied with my art, but I want to see if it's possible to meet
                            photorealistic standards and perhaps hyperrealism. The main issue with this piece is that it
                            was too easy; the contrast really reduced detail meaning that it was mostly just a case of
                            getting a good sketch done and colour by number. Side note; first time with zest-it; only
                            works on thick paper (but I used it with the lips for this piece).

                            So I swapped out the Joker for this in an art competition. I think that Gaiman (right) was
                            well done (the hair felt natural and the shading really achieved that texture), though the
                            space between the nose and the mouth needs to be better detailed; it looks too flat. Hadley
                            (left) was harder to do as her reference was poorer and I had never added fake features on a
                            photorealistic drawing before; the hair down the side of the nose (actually someone else in
                            the reference), the eyeliner and the necklace, The shading was alright but the Drawing just
                            looks too simplistic to see real.

                            So I thought I'd touch it up with a 2B after then maybe bump up to 6 then 8...

                            I did minor tweaks with a 2B before getting bored and going in straight with the 8B before
                            going for mid-tones with 4, using the B to repronounce shape at a few places. Lazy, sloppy
                            and scratchy, but it got the job done :)

                            This is a lot better. The proportions, are correct, and the textures are fairly decent. I just need to blend more and create
                            stronger contrast (I know the gamma is off on this image but even then it still needs work).

                            The colour is well rendered here, and the texture isn't half bad, but the proportion on the eyes need work. All the more reason

                            I need to blend better, but I think I have the lighting down. I also need to improve texture on the clothing.

                            This is interesting, because the lighting isn't as vividly red as it is in the picture; perhaps I got lucky. Either way I would love
                            to try this out again.

                            I finally plucked up the courage to try darker skin tones; it honestly went better than I expected, and I think I will try more to make
                            it easier (and better for practice) to render skin tones if I stick to darker skin tones, because I can get more lead on paper.
