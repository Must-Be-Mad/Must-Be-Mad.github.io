            <h1> How to Deal With Exam Stress?</h1>
            <div style="color:black;">
                <h2 class="cyanpanel">Introduction</h2>
                Let's get something straight, I'm not a professional. I can offer you some advice, based on my
                experience (and note, a whole lot of not researching anything and hoping my advice sticks), about how
                not to stress about your exams (so as to not affect your performance), but if the
                level of stress you are experiencing is severe, and more than you would expect for whichever exam you
                are doing, please seek professional help.
                <br><br>
                That aside, if you ignored above anyway and/or you're interested, allow me to share with you the truth
                about exam-stress; it's completely justified. And no, I don't mean it in the patronising way when others
                say "oh it's good to have a little stress, but don't stress too much" or "the exam doesn't matter as
                much." I mean hey, if that's enough for you, don't let me stop you. But in the average case, it makes
                sense for you to be stressed to the point where your performance is affected. Consider university
                entrance
                exams; different universities have a lot of different things to offer, so it's perfectly reasonable to
                be stressed
                because there's a lot on the line. Let's break down my approach.
            </div>

                <h2 class="cyanpanel">Exam Practice/Mocks</h2>
                <div class="imageparagraph">
                    <p>
                        Quick point; I'm referring to mocks that don't hold any weight; if they offer you some kind of
                        predicted grade that holds
                        value, feel free to read the next section.
                        <br><br>
                        The beginning of exam stress starts with mocks and exam practice. The first thing we need to
                        realise is that there
                        are two main reasons why we get stressed. The first is just the atmosphere; in general I would
                        reccommend asking your
                        institution to have a change of room if you think it affects your performance. The second is
                        more important, you
                        can get stressed because a bad grade in your mock indicates you're not ready for the real thing.
                        However, I propose an
                        ammendment to that perspective.
                        <br><br>
                        If you are stressed during your mock or your practice papers, your grade, quite obviously, will
                        not be very good. However,
                        as a result, the grade you've gotten is just bad data, because it's been skewed by your stress.
                        As a result, to prevent that
                        skew, you need to omit any external factors; what we call 'control variables' if you aren't
                        familiar with STEM terms. The only
                        thing you want to know is, "How well can I do this paper under time?". This is easier said than
                        done of course, but doing it
                        isn't quite as difficult as it seems. Adopt the mentality of, "Here's the time. Here's the
                        paper. I must do the questions <i>on</i>
                        this paper <i>in</i> this time." (not for me, but if you find it helps, repeat this mantra
                        before you start).
                        <br><br>
                        Quite literally, you're doing an impression of being a computer; you have the paper as an input,
                        and the time as a parameter, and you
                        just output the result, nothing else. The result may be that you are quite robotic when you do
                        the paper, but hey, if it works,
                        it works. As a result you will get A*s and there will be milk and honey and- no. That's not the
                        aim of adopting the perspective,
                        and that's (although not certainly) not going to be the case. What you <i>want</i> as an
                        immediate outcome, is good data. A
                        practice paper or mock is your chance to be your own examiner. You want to know how good you
                        are. You can hope you did well of course,
                        but our immediate want is for your data to be sound, and the grade to be an accurate reflection
                        of your ability.

                <h2 class="cyanpanel">The Exam</h2>
                <div class="imageparagraph">
                    <p>
                        I would hope that the slight improvement to your grades (but again not your actual ability) in
                        your
                        practice papers would give a confidence
                        boost. If not, try this:
                        <br><br>
                        Now things have spiced up; our reasons for stress have changed; we're now stressed because the
                        outcome
                        of this exam will have degree of
                        consequence to your future. Like I said, I'm not going to downplay it's significance because I
                        neither
                        know nor care what exam you are
                        doing, I'm just going to assume it's important. So how do we adopt this perspective? Simple, we
                        do
                        the
                        same as before. Adopt the scientist,
                        robot, computer person. But this time we change our reasons, or more specifically, we identify
                        that
                        although the consequences of your future are
                        contingent on your grades, your grades are contingent on your ability. It seems obvious, sure,
                        but
                        it's
                        best to spell it out when adopting this
                        perspective*.
                        <br><br>
                        This perspective helps because what we need to do, as an immediate aim, is to work efficiently.
                        And
                        what
                        we have found is that, when adopting the
                        perspective in our mock and practice papers, the input/output answers over time is what
                        <i>optimises</i>
                        our ability (note that even if you aren't
                        working at the capacity you want; at this point this is the best you can do, so just hope you
                        get
                        lucky). If we deviate from it, we
                        can either do better than our ability, or worse (and let's be honest, it's probably going to be
                        worse).
                        So in order to optimise our marks on our
                        paper, we need to omit any external, again, 'control variables', which include stress. It's also
                        worth
                        noting at this point, that stress impeding your
                        ability during exam usually comes in the form as a distraction (i.e how much weight have you put
                        in
                        for
                        each question). As a result, this is a variable
                        that needs to be omitted.
                        <br><br>
                        To sum it up in a patronising tone, "Do what you did in the mocks."
                        <br><br>
                        *I believe this is because the robotic way of spelling things out gets you in the mode of
                        adopting a
                        robotic way of thinking.

                    <p>
                        Just as a side note, it's worth noting that stress occurs more often as you near the end of the
                        paper.
                        As a result you may find that if you have issues
                        with timing, it may be a good idea to limit how much you can look at the clock; focus on trying
                        to
                        go
                        reasonably fast (and look at the clock at most 2-3 times).
                        As a result, the weight caused by stress may outweigh the loss caused by being less able to time
                        yourself during the paper; at least in my papers,
                        this certainly was the case.

                In summation, be robotic, think only of the test, and the time, and limit how much you look at the
                clock. Okay bye &#60;3
