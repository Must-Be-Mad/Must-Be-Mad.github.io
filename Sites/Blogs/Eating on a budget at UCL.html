            <h1> Eating on a Budget at UCL?</h1>
            <div style="color:black;">
                <h2 class="cyanpanel">Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                My time at UCL is fairly uncommon, as not many people commute from home in London; as a result, I either bring
                a packed lunch and/or eat dinner at home. If you are in an accomadation, this pattern should also be a good
                strategy for lunch and/or dinner. Simply because buying ingredients in bulk and making your own food is cheaper
                than eating out. However, sometimes you may not have the time, or simply just want to eat somewhere else. Here is
                my list of cheap ways to eat out.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div style="color:black;">
                <br>
                <h2 class="cyanpanel">Pret</h2>
                <div class="imageparagraph">
                    <p>
                        I am, ironically, going to start with a place that isn't necessarily food. However, the deal is just so
                        good I just had to add it in. The Pret subscription costs 30 pounds a month which may seem steep. However the
                        deal gives you 20% off the whole menu and 5 free drinks a day, not to mention the first month is 15 pounds. The
                        Pret deal says you aren't allowed to share it with others. However, if you were allowed to, each of you could split
                        the first month fee with each of your emails for 5 months (3 quid each), have a group chat to tell others when you have
                        used the QR code (as you must leave 30 minutes between drinks) and have 5 months of more or less free pret for just 15
                        pounds. But of course the Pret deal says you can't, so don't do that. 
                    </p>

                <h2 class="cyanpanel">Itsu</h2>
                <div class="imageparagraph">
                    <p>
                        Itsu has a great deal. They have their whole sushi and salad menu at 50% off a half hour 
                        before closing. This means most of their sushi is less than £5, and their soups are generally
                        this cheap anyway. The downside is, of course, that you have to wait until later before grabbing
                        it, which is often not very convenient. However, there are two Itsus near UCL. The one further away
                        closes at 7 on weekdays, which is very convenient.
                        <br>
                        Side Note: The student discount (at all times) is 15% off, and does not compound with the 50% off deal.

                <div class="imageparagraph">
                    <p>
                        As of writing, Tesco's meal deal stands at £3.90, and £3.40 for clubcard holders. The Tesco
                        meal deal is ubiquitous amongst university students for its low price, but large pay off. It
                        includes a drink, lunch (often a sandwich or wrap), and snack (I recommend the scotch egg), which
                        is almost always enough to fill you up. Not to mention that Tescos are littered almost everywhere
                        in London, and of course, near UCL. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Domino's pizza tends to have a lot of deals (often changing so I can't specify), but for students
                        they offer (as of writing) 35% off via 'Unidays' which is a free student deal app. Often these deals
                        result in a &#60;£5 pay if you split the purchase with friends.

                    <p>
                        Greggs generally isn't necessarily cheapest option, but they offer small portions at low prices, so it
                        would be amiss not to mention them. If you eat small amounts, greggs is often cheap, and has smaller 
                        queues to back it.

                    <p>
                        'Too good To Go' is an app which searches for extreme discounts on food that is due to be thrown out.
                        This isn't to say the food is poor quality, just that it isn't sold in the store. These often come in
                        the form of 'surprise bags', which are incredibly cheap (but as you can likely tell by the name, not
                        necessarily predictable). It is definitely worth downloading if you are looking for cheap food.

                    <p>
                        Hare Krishna 'food for all' is a stall located between UCL and the SOAS building at lunch hours. Their food
                        is completely free and vegetarian. As a result, they are great to go to for a meal if you are really short
                        on money. They appear near Russel Square, by UCL's institute bar.

                    <p>
                        Another grocery chain, which is not as common in London, but near UCL, Lidl is extremely cheap.
                        Their range is perhaps the cheapest out of all major UK grocery chains. And of course, they have
                        a selection of snack items; from 70p pizza slices (and £4 well sized pizzas) to 35p jam doughnuts.

                <div class="imageparagraph">
                    <p>
                        In general, Meerkats offers a whole bunch of discounts for people who buy insurance through them.
                        However, what many people don't know is that one day travel insurance can go as low as £1, which
                        qualifies for the Meerkat discounts. In general, you can get a whole load of discounts for a price
                        as low as £1. You can find more details at this other blog I found <a href="https://skintdad.co.uk/meerkat-movies-meerkat-meals/">here</a>

                    <p>
                        The Print Room Cafe is one of UCL's student cafe's. Perhaps the best part of this cafe is their
                        jacket potatoes. They are incredibly large, and the cook does not skimp on any of the toppings
                        (to my preference, I love overtopped jacket potatoes). And the best part is, it all costs about 3
                        pounds.

                        <p>
                            McDonald's tends to be expensive, but there are quite a few ways to make a meal out of it for less.
                            Firstly, Mcdonald's has the mayo chicken burger for £1. 2 burgers and chips is more than enough to
                            fill you up. The second option is to fill in the survey on a Mcdonald's reciept. This grants you
                            a burger (of a good size) and chips meal deal for only £2. Failing those two, there are generally a
                            lot of offers from McDonald's, so it's really a matter of finding them.
