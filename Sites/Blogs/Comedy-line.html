                <p>
                In general, when doing stand-up it's tricky trying to decide what is too far in terms of stating a joke. In general,
                many claim the argument that if you don't want to hear it, don't attend the show. I disagree. If someone gives a hate
                speech, I hope the majority would agree that's something to condemn; maybe not legally, but in terms of simply believing
                that talking in such a manner is wrong to do. As a result, this argument is incomplete
                <br><br>
                General disclaimer: I don't intend for this to be a hard and fast rule, nor to I claim to be objectively correct in
                this way of thinking. It's just <i>a</i> way of thinking that you may want to consider. And lastly, I don't push myself
                close to this line in my own stand-up sets; it's not worth the risk. I just won't condemn any <i>other</i> comedian
                who chooses to do so.
                </p>

                <h2 class="cyanpanel">Context</h2>
                <div class="imageparagraph">
                    <p>
                        This is fairly simple. If you intend on making a comedy show 'controversial' or extremely political, there are several
                        points at which you need to consider context. The most simple, perhaps, is reputation. If you have no reputation as a
                        comedian, you're a blank slate. You're relatively more free. If someone attends your first show, it is on them to be
                        tolerant to their highest degree. This is because, as I will later elaborate, there are jokes that some cannot tolerate,
                        of which type is commonplace in the world of comedy. If you disagree with that, that's fine. However, attending a comedy
                        show won't make them magically disappear.
                        <br><br>
                        I don't expect any Trevor Noahs or John Mulaney's to be reading this, but if you have <i>any</i> degree of
                        reputation as am uncontroversial comedian, then an abrupt change without any forewarning is a bad idea. That's not to say
                        non-controversial comedians can never be controversial, but it should be noted that, unless there is information about a
                        specific show stating that you are changing styles, it is your responsibility to ensure your audience knows what topics
                        your show will touch upon.
                        <br><br>
                        The other form of context is 'obvious' but more nuanced. In general, don't make cancer jokes in a room full of cancer victims,
                        or jokes about natural disasters in a city that has just experienced a natural disaster. Of course, I am not saying that
                        someone will be upset by your jokes, and I know many people who can (and can handle a) joke about a bad situation, but when
                        the sample size of people who have bad experiences with whatever you joke about is dramatically increased, your chances of
                        making someone (who's situation is extremely poor) a lot worse is bad. And some jokes don't come without risk, it's true.
                        And for some of those jokes the damage* is small enough to make it the audience's problem. However, for extreme cases, the damage
                        is far worse.
                        <br><br>
                        *Note I say damage, which is subjective to the individual. What I mean more specifically, is the average weight of the insult
                        the joke could cause, not the effect.

                    <p>
                        This is perhaps more nuanced, and I would like to reiterate that this is where <i>I</i> draw the (shaky) line; you may well disagree, but
                        in general, it's within my right to disapprove. It's all to do with what makes the joke funny. The reason being that, in my opinion, the reason
                        you find a joke funny reflects and reaffirms your view. When looking at this, it's important to realise that the reason that a joke is funny
                        isn't the same as the content of the joke. Below is an example:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is one of many race-based Jimmy Carr jokes. The racial theme/stereotype here is that different ethnic groups all look the same. Neither fact
                        nor positive. Note how he has brought up the theme early on, albeit for a different race, before his 'long story' reaches its punchline. We'll get
                        to why this is important but first let's take a look at why the punchline was funny. From my observation, it was funny for two reasons. The first
                        is because of a subversion of expectation. Note that the joke had a strong focus on the comedy club owner's self-righteousness; the expectation is
                        that the guy will say something in retaliation to the guy, however instead it gets thrown in his face by other means- irony, the second reason. 
                        The joke also had another thing going for it in that it set the theme earlier, creating a closure effect and an almost 'callback' to the beginning
                        when delivering the punchline. In neither of those two cases is it strictly relevant or required to be racist or think racit thoughts. Below is an
                        example of where it fails:
                    </p>
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/crdaGolaBxY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <p>
                        This one received a lot of media attention (I like to think that people subconsciously hold this criteria), and it's clear why. It's not inherently
                        clear why this is funny. An argument can be made that there is subversion of expectation here in that 'but no-one ever talks about ____' is usually
                        followed up with some positive justification to pay attention to something unspoken of. However, in the set-up, Carr spoke of the punchline being
                        controversial, preventing a twist form occurring. This is where I take issue. Because intentional or not, the only way to enjoy this joke
                        is if you have explicit negative bias towards a specific group. And when in a crowd, where you laugh along simply because of the delivery,
                        or because others around you are laughing too, this can subconsciously normalise this opinion.

                <h2 class="cyanpanel">Misinformation</h2>
                <div class="imageparagraph">
                    <p>
                        This is perhaps more relevant in LGTBQ+ based stand-up, where misinformation is more widespread. I do not believe that it is a comedian's duty
                        to deliberately avoid the use of misinformation to create a punchline; further they can use it to their heart's content (with caution that their
                        jokes land of course). I'd like to restate that this is where I draw the line in my opinion of other comedians; and not a line I intend on
                        nearing myself. The reason is because, unlike above, the entire prerequisite of a comedy show is that everything in it is fake. Subconscious
                        bias towards different groups is not refuted by this because it is not something you explicitly learn, it's something felt. However, information
                        is something you consciously gain. It is true that you can learn something subconsciously, but nothing can arise from subconscious knowledge
                        without you realising it.
                        <br><br>
                        Take, for example, the myth that goldfish are forgetful. If you explicitly think of information related to goldfish, and that comes up, it will
                        either have an unidentified source or will be remembered from a comedy show; neither of which will improve how much you believe in it. But perhaps
                        that isn't fair; what about negative stereotypes? Yes, you can subconsciously believe a stereotype and that can be (re)affirmed at a comedy show. 
                        The reason is that in order for it to take root, it needs to be the part of the joke that makes you laugh; not irony, not subversion of expectation
                        etc. If the setup of the joke uses a stereotype, it is forgotten and dismissed as a means to an end/punchline. As a result, the above criterion
                        stands
                    </p>

                As a result, I believe a focus on both the context, and why a joke is funny is the best way to determine whether a comedian has 'crossed the line'.
