            <div style="color:black;">
                <h2 class="cyanpanel">Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                When browsing interesting facts about travel and engineering on youtube, I often come across videos that talk about trains
                and other forms of public transport being superior than cars for both environmental and efficiency reasons. These claims are
                highly supported and backed up with evidence; I am not planning to dispute their validity. However, when it comes to presenting
                these ideas, they often omit minor counterarguments that would occur to the average person; often presenting a one-sided
                argument.
                <br><br>
                Note that I am not an engineer. I am not a specialist in logistics. Whilst I can infer counterarguments to the ideas I present
                below, I don't share them. This is because the purpose of this post is to highlight independent thinking; the idea of taking an
                argument presented to you and trying to justify the converse. In the past, when I came across these videos, I took the arguments
                blindly, and without thinking of the holes that were presented. If by sheer chance, you are in this position, then this post
                can hopefully serve as a strong example of how playing devil's advocate can promote better deductive reasoning.
                <br><br>
                I live in London's suburbs, which has a good mix of both public transport and cars. Hopefully, this can provide some context as to
                any biases I may be subject to.

                <h2 class="cyanpanel">Why people drive cars?</h2>
                <div class="imageparagraph">
                    <p>
                        When presented arguments for public transport, oftentimes reasons are neglected for driving cars. The focus is almost
                        entirely based on efficiency and cost. In the former case, it can vary. For example, driving is almost certainly more
                        efficient than taking a bus (because buses use roads and cars do not stop). Depending on how much a train aligns with
                        the destination, a train can be more, or less efficient than driving. It is certainly the case that you can never have
                        a reasonable train network that prevents any such inefficiencies from occuring. The latter case can also change depending
                        on the availability and demand for parking, which is a massive issue in terms of space.
                        <br><br>
                        However, there are some arguments that are heavily ignored. The first is personal safety. Statistically (I'm fairly sure),
                        cars kill more people on average than trains or buses. However, that isn't the problem. The problem is how people <i>feel</i>.
                        Despite the statistics, it is (again I haven't researched this) more likely that people feel more safe when they are in their
                        cars. This is because of crime (again I live in London), especially against women. Being on a train is an uncomfortable
                        experience due to the fact that you have to be wary of other people. As a result, this makes people want to drive more.
                        It's possible to make an argument that this doesn't matter if you (indirectly) force people not to drive with efficiency and
                        cost reasons.
                        <br><br>
                        Another reason people prefer to drive is the ability to transport items. Cars have spare seats and/or a boot in
                        which you can store items for easy transport; this is great for heavy shopping and for personal use. Linked in with this
                        is child safety; it's impossible for a child to get lost within a car than by taking a train or a bus; in most cases this
                        shouldn't happen, but it does take a lot off a parent's mind; preventing stress. You're also more able to carry expensive items,
                        such as handbags, without the fear of being an easy target.

                <h2 class="cyanpanel">You can't get rid of roads</h2>
                <div class="imageparagraph">
                    <p>
                        This argument is not too common, and alas I cannot find evidence of it being made; but it can be implictly stated when justifying
                        narrow streets as a better alternative to a broad road alternative. A fairly wide road should exist next to all buildings. The 
                        reason being that public services, such as ambulances, firetrucks, and police should be able to access any and all buildings
                        and get there in good time. That being said, it is still justifiable to argue for fewer lanes in existing roads. However the restriction
                        of roads would be detrimental to the efficiency of these public services.
                        <br><br>
                        Another argument against public transport is how much you make individuals depend on it. If the entirety of a city is dependent on public
                        transport, then strike action, justified or not, will cause a larger disruption. Note that strike action relates necessisity to pay, as
                        opposed to work done to pay. By increasing necessisity without increasing workload, this creates disproportionate pay among government-run
                        sectors.
                        <br><br>
                        It's also worth noting that, although the demand for cars being proportional to the supply of viability (e.g motorways staying jammed
                        no matter how many lanes are added), this can also be a good thing. For example, take taxi services; like them or not, no matter how many
                        drivers join Uber, there will always be work. Public transport is bottlenecked by the amount of vehicles in operations and stops available.
                        As a result, a case can be made that the demand for driving provides more work than public sectors (note that the Uber argument is shaky
                        at best; can you think of other jobs related to the demand for driving?).

               <p>
                To reiterate, I'm not trying to create a bullet-proof argument against public transport; but to give an example of how there is no such claim,
                such as public transport being better, that is completely bullet-proof. More specifically, there is no video, blog, or paper that can <i>alone</i>
                make a bullet-proof claim (within reason). This blog post is here to cast just enough doubt to get people to think independently, and to play devil's
                advocate, by using the topic of public transport as an example. If it interests you, by all means try to find counterarguments to the points I have
                listed above.
