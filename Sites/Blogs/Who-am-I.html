            <div style="color:black;">
                <h2 class="cyanpanel">Introduction</h2>
                When I first thought of writing this I thought I would do this introspective, philosophical sort of
                thing. In the end I decided to settle on something simpler. My name, to put it bluntly, is Daya Singh, a
                first year (as of writing) mathematics student at University College London. I take interest in drawing,
                doing stand-up comedy, logic and coding (badly).

                <h2 class="cyanpanel">Early Life</h2>
                I was born in London, a nice city filled with not-so-nice people (such as myself). Skipping ahead beyond
                the boring bits, I did Design & Technology, Computer Science, History, French and Triple science (aside
                from of course the more obvious ones). Skipping adead into my not so early life, I took Maths, Further Maths,
                Physics and Chemistry A levels. I also took STEP II and III.

                <h2 class="cyanpanel">Now</h2>
                Currently I am an undergrad mathematics student at UCL. I spend most of my time playing pool in the institute bar,
                doing stand-up comedy shows, and a minor little thing called studying; maths isn't going to... erm... <i>maths</i>
                itself. I enjoy algebra, analysis, and logic; with luck I should be taking some philosophy electives

                <h2 class="cyanpanel">Stuff I made up to make this post interesting</h2>
                At the age of 5 I was invited by President Barack Obama to speak in Congress, and as a result, I single-handedly
                solved the financial banking crisis of 2008. In my spare time I play russian roulette over the phone with Boris
                Johnson. Some of my time travel exploits involve stopping the meteorite hitting the earth in late January of 1998,
                preventing the production of a sequel to Batman and Robin, and the murder of Jason Todd (who do you think rigged
                the vote?).
