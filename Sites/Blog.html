                In general, I am a man with a particular set of <s>skills</s> interests, one of which is making exam
                papers weirdly enough. Designing questions is pretty fun, but it takes a while to get the hang of. Also
                note that not all of these have mark schemes. Feel free to contact me though if you want your answers
                checked.

                    <h2 class="cyanpanel"><b>Who am I?</b></h2>
                    <p>A very philosophical question that is, but I can answer it... I hope. Mathematics student,
                    comedian(ish), a really awesome humble guy, I just like to <i>do</i> stuff. How's that for my first
                    Blog synopsis!</p>

                    <h2 class="cyanpanel"><b>Where to draw the comedic line?</b></h2>
                    <p>It's always in the news. You hear one thing about a comedian (usually Jimmy Carr), being cancelled
                    or whatever for saying a joke in poor taste. I do comedy (at a stretch I do it <s>well</s> okayish),
                    so I feel entitled like everyone else on the internet to put in my two-pence worth.</p>

                    <h2 class="cyanpanel"><b>Are cars really that bad?</b></h2>
                    <p>The short answer, which seems to be the general consensus, is yes. And I'm not willing to disagree
                    (after all, this is not my area of expertise). However, any time anyone (online) talks about
                    replacing cars with public transport and biking, the argument is pretty one-sided. My points here
                    are gonna likely be easily defeated, but the reasons aren't inherently obvious to me.</p>

                    <p>In general, I don't easily get fazed by exams. Don't get me wrong, I will bawl my eyes out
                    when I don't get the result I want, but in the run up, there are some methods I have come up with
                    to help me feel... not awful. So, using my powers of making myself feel better, I will attempt the
                    daring feat of trying to help you, the reader, feel less stress.</p>
