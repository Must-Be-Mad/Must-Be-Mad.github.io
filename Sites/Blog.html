                This blog has a lot to it. Sometimes I want to talk about my university, other times a bit of cool
                maths. I have a bit of this and a bit of that, but hopefully, in the end, you will find it all an
                interesting read.

                            comedian(ish), a really awesome humble guy, I just like to <i>do</i> stuff. How's that for

                            to students studying in London.

                        <p>UCL has a diverse range of food options, and often, with so much choice, the pricier options
                            often seem to outweigh the cheaper ones. However, don't you fret, because there are a lot
                            more options than you may otherwise think.

                            to go see it for myself; find out more about my experience, and more in my video.

                        <p>In general, I don't easily get fazed by exams. Don't get me wrong, I will bawl my eyes out
                            when I don't get the result I want, but in the run up, there are some methods I have come up
                            with
                            to help me feel... not awful. So, using my powers of making myself feel better, I will
                            attempt
                            the
                            daring feat of trying to help you, the reader, feel less stress.</p>

                        <p>It's always in the news. You hear one thing about a comedian (usually Jimmy Carr), being
                            cancelled
                            or whatever for saying a joke in poor taste. I do comedy (at a stretch I do it <s>well</s>
                            okayish),
                            so I feel entitled like everyone else on the internet to put in my two-pence worth.</p>

                    <h2 class="cyanpanel"><b>Are cars really that bad?</b></h2>
                    <p>The short answer, which seems to be the general consensus, is yes. And I'm not willing to
                        disagree
                        (after all, this is not my area of expertise). However, any time anyone (online) talks about
                        replacing cars with public transport and biking, the argument is pretty one-sided. My points
                        here
                        are gonna likely be easily defeated, but the reasons aren't inherently obvious to me.</p>
