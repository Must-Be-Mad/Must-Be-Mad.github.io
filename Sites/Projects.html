                You're probably wondering what on earth is the difference between this and the Blog page. Sit down, shut
                up, and listen. The difference is that the stuff here are things I did, that took time, that I learned a
                lot from. That's the definition you can use until I inevitably contradict it. Either way, it's my site,
                my rules (please don't leave I'm so lonely).

                        <p>
                            So I try to do a lot of things for a lot of people a lot of the time. And I did that most of all at UCL. To any future employers, or as a light flex, here is a compilation of the work I did off my own back for the past couple years that I have spent at UCL.

                        <p>Don't lie, we've all had that one hobby we picked up over lockdown. Mind was drawing and
                            colouring
                            portraits. After a while I thought I would document how I went from 'bad' to 'sort of
                            passable', learning
                            each lesson along the way like an avid <s>student</s> self-learner. Maybe one day I'll pick
                            it up again. But
                            if you think you will click this and find something cool, 'Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enters
                            There!'

                        <p>My first website, that is kinda bad in terms of html and css design, the site has some pretty
                            good content although there's not much to say about it aside from how I made it, why I made
                            it, where I
                            got the content from, and what I plan to do with it; like I said, not much to say about it
                            once
                            you've gotten those out the way</p>

                    <p> Together with my friend Sophie, we decided to try and whittle down the classic 7-segment display
                        into just 4 segments. I will be honest, we only did this for a day before we found a result we
                        liked; but I think
                        it's decent. It took about 3-4 iterations before we finished and I think it turned out pretty
                        decent.

                        text on a site that's actually good. Either way, I had a blast making it. I learned a lot of new
                        things, did some fun tricks, and most of all, I have <s>hubristically</s> justifiably made it
                        all about me. This project post is basically all that led up to it.</p>
